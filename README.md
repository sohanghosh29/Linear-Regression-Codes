# Linear-Regression-Codes

Contains Linear Regression Codes using Closed Form Solution and Gradient Descent without using any specialized library other than Numpy.
In the Portland Housing Scenario, Scikit-learn has been used to perform K-fold Cross-Validation.

1. Data_Table.txt: Contains a small sample of data denoting housing prices. The columns include 'Size of House', 'No of Beds' and the variable to be predicted 'Price'.
2. LinRegScratch.ipynb: Performs Linear Regression using both the Closed Form Solution and Gradient Descent approach on the 'Data_Table.txt' dataset.
3. LinReg_Portland.ipynb: Performs Gradient Descent using K-fold Cross Validation to calculate MSE on the Portland Housing Dataset available in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kennethjohn/housingprice).
